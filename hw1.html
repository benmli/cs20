        I grew up in Rockville, Maryland.

            Hainan, China is my favorite place because many of my relatives live
            there and it feels like home to me. <br>
            It has nice tropical weather and palm trees everywhere, and I love seeing chickens running around all
            the streets.

            My favorite restaurant:
            <a href = https://unclejulios.com/ target=“_blank”>
                Uncle Julio's
            </a>
            <br>
            Something no one would expect about me is that I got in a car crash
            about a year ago.
